In this SQL based Final Project, I was appointed as the first Data Analyst for LetsMeet, an online network for
professionals and enthusiasts to meet and experience common interests together. With information given from 
various SQL files, the goal of this project was to respond to requests made from various departments such as
the engineering team, web designers, app developers, and Vice President of the company. As the first Data
Analyst of LetsMeet, data cleaning and manipulating was applied to ensure better querying outcomes 
leading to more accurate results. Furthermore, with more accurate and clean data, team members in other
departments would be able to use the intel to gain valuable insight and continue effectively building 
the company.
